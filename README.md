# Project-Crake

## What is Project Crake?

Project Crake, which began as a school project and is named after the mad scientist, gene-editting extraordinate from Margaret Atwood's _Oryx and Crake_, is a project built in Unity which is capable of modeling simple evolution in a bacteria and its predator, an amoeba. This simulation began, and still is, an exercise in realizing the beauty of emergence. Truly, the simulation isn't that complicated. Yet, some strikingly realistic evolution can take place naturally, and as you, the user, artifically increases or decreases the pressure of natural selection through the modification of environment variables.

Every lifeform in the simulation has a unique set of genes which mutate as they reproduce, and the average for each gene's "level of expression" is outputted to a CSV in "Assets/Report/Data.csv", meaning that you can graph and watch the bacteria and amoeba evolve over time. 


## How to use Project Crake

Project Crake is a Unity project built in 2022.1.6f1 on Apple Silicon. You will need to create a Unity Project and clone this repository into your project directory, replacing any Unity-created folders (Assets, Packages, Project Settings, etc) with the folders contained within this directory. Unlike most Unity projects, Project Crake is **not** designed to be built into an executable, but rather ran with the Unity Editor so that you are given significantly more control and have more real-time data exposed. 

## What's next?

Fundamentally, Project Crake is complete. However, it is a bit ugly. Thus, some gradual improvements to art, post-processing, and UI are being made to "freshen up" the project, as well as make it more user friendly.
